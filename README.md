<h3>Essential Java Examples</h3>
The examples in this project apply to the concepts explained in the 
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/" target="_blank">Trail: Essential Classes</a>. 
<ol>
	<li>The exception examples demonstrates the exception mechanism and how it is used to handle errors and 
	other exceptional conditions. How to throw and catch exceptions, what to do with an exception once 
	it has been caught, and how to use the exception class hierarchy.</li>
	<li>Basic I/O examples cover the Java platform classes used for basic input and output. It focuses primarily 
	on I/O Streams, a powerful concept that greatly simplifies  I/O operations. The lesson also looks at 
	<b>serialization</b>, which lets a program write whole objects out to streams and read them back again. 
	Then the examples show some file system operations, including random access files. </li>
</ol>
