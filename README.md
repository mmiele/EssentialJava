<h1>Tutorial about Java essentials.</h1>
This tutorial discusses classes from the Java platform that are essential to most programmers.

<ol>
	<li>Exceptions explains the exception mechanism and how it is used to handle errors and 
	other exceptional conditions. This lesson describes what an exception is, how to throw and 
	catch exceptions, what to do with an exception once it has been caught, and how to use the 
	exception class hierarchy.</li>
	<li>Basic I/O covers the Java platform classes used for basic input and output. 
	It focuses primarily on I/O Streams, a powerful concept that greatly simplifies 
	I/O operations. The lesson also looks at Serialization, 
	which lets a program write whole objects out to streams and read them back again. 
	Then the lesson looks at some file system operations, including random access files. </li>
